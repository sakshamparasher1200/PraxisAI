---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a production-ready, full-stack AI medical scheduling web app named **Praxis ©**. It must automate patient booking, reduce admin work, and offer a futuristic UX. The final output must be a single, runnable Next.js project folder, structured for Vercel deployment.

## 🎨 UX & Design Philosophy

-   **UI:** Futuristic, interactive, and professional 🤖
-   **Theme:** Mandatory dark mode 🌃
-   **Palette:** `#0a041c` (dark blue), `#8a2be2` (purple), `#00f5ff` (cyan accent)
-   **Layout:** Clean, spacious, and centered content 📐
-   **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for smooth transitions. Implement glassmorphism for nav/modals and glow effects for interactive elements ✨
-   **Imagery:** High-quality stock photos of modern clinics/doctors, some as low-opacity backgrounds 🖼️
-   **Typography:** 'Inter' or 'Poppins' ✍️
